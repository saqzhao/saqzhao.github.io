I just graduated from MIT with my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering (6-3) and Mathematics (18). This upcoming 2024-25 school year, I will be pursuing my M.Eng in Computer Science under Prof. Manolis Kellis and advised by Dr. Riley Mangan, studying variant effect on cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility.
