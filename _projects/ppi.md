(Current project) An undergraduate research project under the direction of Prof. Lindsay Case and Jibin Sadisavan, Ph.D. at MIT. I am analysing literature data for potential adaptor proteins in focal adhesions using protein-protein interaction databases such as String and Biogrid. We are testing candidates for interaction with known focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin.
